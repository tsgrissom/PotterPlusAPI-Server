# PotterPlusAPI-Server

This is the plugin side of [PotterPlusAPI](https://github.com/PotterPlus/PotterPlusAPI) which powers all the custom plugins on the PotterPlus among other things:

* WIP Re-writing Essentials commands we need so we can drop EssentialsX
* Database tracking of user sessions with a MySQL database
* Login history tracking for administrative purposes
* WhoIs command interface for learning more about specific players
* Tracking of player info like role, Hogwarts house, (hopefully soon) year, other progression through LuckPerms
